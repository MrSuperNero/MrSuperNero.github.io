                    This is a form from Facebook's website. Some information they ask for include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First Name</li>
                    <li>Last Name</li>
                    <li>Birthday</li>
                    <li>Desired Password</li>
                    <li>Gender</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    This form seems a bit dense with the small space between the input fields.

                    This is a form from Hulu's website. Some information they ask for include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Email</li>
                    <li>Password</li>
                    <li>Name</li>
                    <li>Birthdate</li>
                    <li>Gender</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    I really like this registration field because it's spaced out and feels really clean.
                    There is no clutter and everything is simple.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="form">
                <div class="img-wrapper">
                    <img src="../assets/gmail.png" alt="Gmail form">
                </div>

                <p>
                    This is a form from Gmail's website. Some information they ask for include:
                </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First Name</li>
                        <li>Last Name</li>
                        <li>Username for email</li>
                        <li>Password</li>
                    </ul>
                <p>
                    This one is also rather simple. While it does not feel as cluttered as Facebook's registration section,
                    it doesn't feel as clean as Hulu's.
                </p>

            <div class="form">
                <div class="img-wrapper">
                    <img src="../assets/zwift.png" alt="Zwift form">
                </div>

                <p>
                    This is a form from Zwift's website. Some information they ask for include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First Name</li>
                    <li>Last Name</li>
                    <li>Email</li>
                    <li>Desired Password</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The input fields are rather large and the placeholder text seem to blend in with the background, which is somewhat hard to read.
                    The placeholders are also not vertically centered, which I believe they should be. They also do not ask for much information, such as birthday,
                    but they simply have a button to ask if the user is older than 16 years old. The caption text below "Create An Account" also seems unnecessary and
                    just clutters up the form.
