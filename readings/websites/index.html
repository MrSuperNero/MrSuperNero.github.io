                        I like the Matrix-vibe from this website. It is also really interesting how the developer made the text into symbols like that. <br>
                        It seems like it was a simple illustration from Photoshop/Illustrator or something, 
                        but it makes me wonder if it is possible to make this design purely from code.

                        The way the background and the text in the foreground interact with each other. The background appears to have a reduced opacity <br>
                        or some sort of dark overlay to really make the white text pop on the site.

                        Here, the color really makes the webpage pop. The rainbow borders around the title (although you can't see it) <br>
                        are animated and "move" which really bring attention to the title area.

                        The webpage here is rather simple, but the subtlety of the page is really attractive to me. The font is very simple but <br>
                        has a sort of elegance to it. The different fonts and the colors really complement each other.

                        This one here is really cool because I get old-school hacker vibes from this. With the black and bright green colors, on top <br>
                        of the futuristic/scientific/computer-themed image at the top really capitalizes on this feel.

                        The main thing that popped out to me for this website was the interactivity. The website's feature that tracks the mouse and gives <br>
                        the user a peek at the artwork that the company makes is a really unique way to draw the user in. The images beneath the black rectangle <br>
                        were all really interesting for the milliseconds that you could see them.

                    <p>
                        I never thought I could be interested about a "corn revolution", but after playing around with the website, I can honestly say <br>
                        that corn may be my favorite vegetable. I know, there actually isn't much about corn and the website features don't highlight <br>
                        corn that much, but the main thing that really brings me in here is the amount of interaction I can have with the website <br>
                        and how futuristic it looks. The titles/headers of the page "breaks down" when the mouse hovers over it and the transition between <br>
                        pages really capture my attention. I can't stop playing with it. I want to make something like this one day.

                        This is another website with some microinteraction that is fun to play with. This website also has a feature that tracks the mouse <br>
                        position and has a green reticle chase after it, kind of making it like a fun game of "cat and mouse" (see what I did there?). <br>
                        The background image constantly changing is also an attention-grabbing feature that really focuses the user's attention to the center <br>
                        of the page.

                        This website is not as interactive as the other ones, but this one has a really subtle and mute color palette which is not something <br>
                        you see everyday. However, the infinitely rotating image of the mountain in the back really makes me feel like I'm in a helicopter on <br>
                        my way to my timeshare in Vermont to go ski in the 80's (I suck at skiing but that's besides the point).

                        This website is somewhat similar to some of the other ones, like the DWL Media website, where there is mouse tracking, except this time, <br>
                        the developers use an image to chase after your mouse only after you're trying to get into the website. The color scheme, in addition to the <br>
                        images and the fonts and interaction on the website really give this site a sunshine/happy-go-lucky vibe which I really enjoy. I feel <br>
                        happier after using this site, which is (not so) surprising.
